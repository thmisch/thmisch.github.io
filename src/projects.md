# Projects
Here are all my cool active projects:

## Nsp (New simple protocol)

## Nsc (New simple chat)
Nsc is a secure and user-friendly chat app powered by Nsp. Enjoy fast and easy communication with end-to-end encryption, group chats, and more.

## se (simpleditor)
Want a *small* and extensible text editor? Also like vim-style text editors 
and *Python*? Then `se` is right for you.

All of these projects are free & open source and available on my Github.
