# About
Hi there! I'm *themisch [she/her]*. I'm passionate about all things tech-related, from Python programming to 3D printing and networking.

I'm a big fan of programming in Python and have spent countless hours building projects in this language. I also have experience with C, Crystal and Zig programming languages, which I find equally exciting.

In addition to programming, I love tinkering with computers and learning about the latest tech trends. I'm also a fan of maths and enjoy using it to solve complex problems.

When I'm not coding or tinkering with tech, you can usually find me reading books or watching movies. I'm always on the lookout for new and exciting stories to explore.

Thanks for stopping by my site! If you have any questions or just want to say hi, feel free to drop me a [message](contact.html).
