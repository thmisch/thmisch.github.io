<h1 id="about">About</h1>

<p>Hi there! I&#8217;m <em>themisch [she&#47;her]</em>. I&#8217;m passionate about all things tech-related, from Python programming to 3D printing and networking.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of programming in Python and have spent countless hours building projects in this language. I also have experience with C and Zig programming languages, which I find equally exciting.</p>

<p>In addition to programming, I love tinkering with computers and learning about the latest tech trends. I&#8217;m also a fan of maths and enjoy using it to solve complex problems.</p>

<p>When I&#8217;m not coding or tinkering with tech, you can usually find me reading books or watching movies. I&#8217;m always on the lookout for new and exciting stories to explore.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by my site! If you have any questions or just want to say hi, feel free to drop me a <a href="contact.html">message</a>.</p>
